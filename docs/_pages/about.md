## Way0utwest

During his first trip to Denver, Steve bought a book for his son, titled [**Way Out West Lives a Coyote Named Frank**](https://amzn.to/2ZA5GWx). There was also a store in the Denver Airport called "Way Out West". This was in the late 90s, and when Steve moved to Denver and needed an online name, he chose "way0utwest". This has been his handle on many platforms since that time.
