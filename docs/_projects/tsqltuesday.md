# T-SQL Tuesday

The T-SQL Tuesday blog party was originally created by Adam Machanic. He managed this for a few years before turning this over to Steve Jones.

Steve set up a central site at [tsqltuesday.com](http://tsqltuesday.com/) where the monthly invitations are captured and archived, along with various tags to allow people to browse the site.
