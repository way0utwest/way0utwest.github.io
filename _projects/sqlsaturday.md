SQL Saturday is a brand and franchise for running technical events. Steve is working with Redgate Software and Microsoft to build a nonprofit foundation that will further the use and growth of the brand.

## History

SQL Saturday was the brainchild of Andy Warren, who wanted to find a way to bring the conference experience to more people in a local area. His partners, Brian Knight and Steve Jones, helped him to form this idea and begin holding events in local areas.
